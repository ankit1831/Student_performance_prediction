# 📚 Student Performance Prediction

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to predict student performance based on various factors such as study time, past grades, extracurricular activities, and parental education. By leveraging machine learning models, the system provides insights that help educators and students improve academic outcomes.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- User-friendly predictions based on input parameters

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and more
- **Web Framework:** Flask 🌐

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Student demographic information** (age, gender, parental education)
- **Academic data** (study hours, previous grades, test scores)
- **Other influencing factors** (attendance, extracurricular activities)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project includes:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Visualizing relationships between features
- Identifying key factors affecting student performance

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
The following models are implemented and evaluated:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5. **XGBoost**
6. **Gradient Boost**

The models are assessed based on accuracy, RMSE, and R-squared values.

## 🏆 Results & Insights
- The best-performing model is determined based on various evaluation metrics.
- Key insights help students and educators make informed decisions to improve performance.

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements
- Deployment using Flask for real-time predictions
- Feature importance analysis using SHAP
- Implementation of Deep Learning models
